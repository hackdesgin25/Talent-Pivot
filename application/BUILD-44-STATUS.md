## 🔍 Current Issue: MySQL User Creation Required

The application is **99% ready**. The only remaining step is creating the MySQL user in Google Cloud SQL:

### Required Action in Google Cloud Console:
1. **Navigate to**: [Cloud SQL Instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances)
2. **Click on your MySQL instance**
3. **Go to "Users" tab**
4. **Click "ADD USER ACCOUNT"**
5. **Create user with:**
   - **Username**: `sqlserver`
   - **Password**: `TalentPivot@1`
   - **Host**: `%` (allow from any IP)
6. **Verify database `candidate_hub` exists** (in "Databases" tab)

### Test After User Creation:
```powershell
.\diagnose-deployment.ps1
```

## 📈 Progress Summary
